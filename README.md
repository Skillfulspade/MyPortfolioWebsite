# My Portfolio Website
## A quick demonstration of my skills with my portfolio on GitHub!
### Last Update: 1/10/2024
I wanted to do this little project to help me get a job before I graduate!  I heard you can host websites using GitHub and wanted to try this out for a spin!
### Webpages I want to include are:
* Home Page
  * Summary of every page while also being a hub for finding pages with more detail.
* About Page
  * More detailed information about who I am and what interests me etc...
* Projects Page
  * Many sub-pages of my projects that are relevant.
  * at least six to start.
  * 3 big and 3 small projects! 
* Contact Page
  * A more in-depth page about the best ways to reach me and my contacts
* Certification/feats Page
  * If I have the time I may want a page where I have all my accomplishments but this is to be added later
## How My Project Works
So far this is just where I will store all the files I use for my website but soon I will add how to run and download my site etc...

## How to install/preview my portfolio
* This is where I would list how to see my site

## How to contribute
* Rules would go here if I plan to add contributes
  
## Found a bug or think I should add a feature?
* I will eventually a way to weigh in on things here.

## Known issues (Work in progress)
* So far there's no working page so no issues...
